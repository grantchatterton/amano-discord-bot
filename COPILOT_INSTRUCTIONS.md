## Commit Messages

When writing commit messages, please follow the Conventional Commits specification:

- **feat:** A new feature
- **fix:** A bug fix
- **docs:** Documentation only changes
- **style:** Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor:** A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf:** A code change that improves performance
- **test:** Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- **chore:** Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

Each commit message should start with a type followed by a short description, e.g., `feat: add user authentication`.
