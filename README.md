# Amano Discord Bot

[![Invite Amano](https://img.shields.io/badge/Invite%20To%20Your%20Server-%235865F2.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1315330069287276576&permissions=117760&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands)

Amano is a Discord bot based off the character Ernest Amano from Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth. It is used for automated replies and a set of fun utility commands. It was built with Node.js, discord.js, and Sequelize ORM. The bot uses SQLite (in-memory) for development and supports MySQL or PostgreSQL for production. The bot can run locally, be deployed in Docker, or run in other Node.js-compatible environments.

I plan on updating this application in the future to support customization for who/what the bot should behave as.

## Features

- Automatic replies to messages containing configured swear words with a configurable chance
- AI-powered responses when messages mention "ernest" (uses OpenAI if configured, otherwise uses fallback generic replies)
- Slash commands (see Commands below)
- Message tracking system for personalized AI interactions (opt-in)

<!-- END COMMANDS SECTION -->

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (LTS recommended)
- npm
- A Discord application and bot token (from the Discord Developer Portal)
- OpenAI API key (optional, for AI-powered responses)

## Obtaining a Discord Bot Token

To run Amano, you'll need to create a Discord application and bot through the Discord Developer Portal. Follow these steps to obtain your bot token and application ID:

1. Log in to the Discord Developer Portal
   - Visit [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Log in with your Discord account
   - If you don't have a Discord account, you'll need to create one first at [https://discord.com](https://discord.com)

2. Create a new application
   - Click the "New Application" button in the top-right corner
   - Enter a name for your application (e.g., "Amano Bot" or "My Ernest Bot")
   - Read and accept Discord's Terms of Service and Developer Policy
   - Click "Create"

3. Copy your Application ID
   - On the "General Information" page, you'll see your "Application ID" (also called Client ID)
   - Click "Copy" to copy this ID — you'll need it for the `APPLICATION_ID` environment variable
   - Keep this page open as you'll need to come back to it

4. Create a bot
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Bot"
   - Click the "Add Bot" button (or "Reset Token" if a bot already exists)
   - Confirm by clicking "Yes, do it!" when prompted

5. Configure bot settings
   - Under "Privileged Gateway Intents", enable the following:
     - **Message Content Intent** (required for the bot to read message content)
   - Save changes if prompted

6. Retrieve your bot token
   - In the "Bot" section, find the "TOKEN" section
   - Click "Reset Token" (if this is your first time, it may say "Copy" instead)
   - Click "Yes, do it!" to confirm if prompted
   - Click "Copy" to copy your bot token
   - **Important**: Store this token securely — you won't be able to see it again
   - If you lose the token, you'll need to reset it and update your environment configuration

7. Add the token and Application ID to your environment configuration
   - Add both values to your `.env` file (see Quick start below)
   - Never commit bot tokens to version control or share them publicly
   - Anyone with your bot token can control your bot

Security Notes:
- Keep your bot token secret and secure — treat it like a password
- If your token is accidentally exposed (e.g., committed to a public repository), reset it immediately in the Developer Portal
- Discord will automatically reset your token if they detect it has been compromised

## Obtaining an OpenAI API Key (Optional)

To use Amano's AI-powered features, you'll need an OpenAI API key. If you don't configure an OpenAI API key, the bot will still work but will use fallback generic replies instead of AI-generated responses when messages mention "ernest". Follow these steps to obtain one:

1. Create an OpenAI account
   - Visit [https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
   - Sign up for a new account or log in if you already have one
   - Note: You may need to verify your email address and provide a phone number

2. Navigate to the API keys section
   - Once logged in, go to [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Or click on your profile icon in the top-right corner and select "API keys" from the menu

3. Generate a new API key
   - Click the "+ Create new secret key" button
   - Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Amano Discord Bot")
   - Click "Create secret key"
   - **Important**: Copy the key immediately and store it securely — you won't be able to see it again
   - If you lose the key, you'll need to generate a new one

4. Add the key to your environment configuration
   - Add the key to your `.env` file (see Quick start below)
   - Never commit API keys to version control or share them publicly

Note: OpenAI API usage is billed based on consumption. Make sure to review [OpenAI's pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) and set up billing limits in your account settings to avoid unexpected charges.

## Quick start — run locally

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create environment file

The app loads environment variables from a `.env` file in the project root. You can copy the example template to get started:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` to include your credentials:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
APPLICATION_ID=your_application_id_here
# Optional - for AI-powered responses (fallback to generic replies if not provided)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
# Optional - defaults to 20
MAX_MESSAGE_LIMIT=20
```

Notes:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN` is required for the bot to login.
- `APPLICATION_ID` is used when registering slash commands (`npm run deploy`).
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` is optional. If not provided, the bot will use fallback generic replies instead of AI-generated responses.
- The app reads database configuration from `DB_*` environment variables. By default it uses SQLite in-memory (equivalent to `DB_DIALECT=sqlite` and `DB_STORAGE=:memory:`). To persist a local development database set `DB_STORAGE` to a file path (for example `DB_STORAGE=./data/dev.db`).
- For production, set `DB_DIALECT` to your production dialect (for example `mysql` or `postgres`) and provide the corresponding `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST` (and optionally `DB_PORT`) environment variables. See Environment variables reference below.

3. Register slash commands (optional but recommended before first run)

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This uses `src/util/deploy.js` and requires `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `APPLICATION_ID` in your environment.

4. Start the bot

```bash
npm start
```

You should see the bot initialize and log in using your provided token.

## Docker

The repository contains a `Dockerfile` and `compose.yaml` for containerized runs.

Before running with Docker, create a `.env` file in the project root with your configuration (you can copy `.env.example` as a starting point).

Build and run using Docker Compose:

```bash
# from project root
docker compose up --build
```

Note: The `compose.yaml` loads environment variables from the `.env` file in the project root. Make sure to create this file with your configuration before running.

### Run with Docker (without docker-compose)

Build the image from the project root:

```bash
docker build -t amano-discord-bot:latest .
```

Run the container using an .env file (recommended):

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the required environment variables (e.g. `DISCORD_TOKEN=...` and any other variables the bot needs).

2. Start the container:

```bash
docker run --env-file .env \
  --name amano-discord-bot \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -d amano-discord-bot:latest
```

Or run by passing environment variables directly (OPENAI_API_KEY is optional):

```bash
docker run -e DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token \
  -e APPLICATION_ID=your_application_id \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key \
  --name amano-discord-bot \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -d amano-discord-bot:latest
```

Mount local data if the bot needs persistent storage or config files:

```bash
docker run --env-file .env \
  -v "$(pwd)/data":/app/data \
  --name amano-discord-bot \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -d amano-discord-bot:latest
```

Notes

- You normally do not need to expose ports for a Discord bot unless it runs a web/health endpoint — if so, add `-p <host_port>:<container_port>`.
- View logs: `docker logs -f amano-discord-bot`
- Enter a running container shell: `docker exec -it amano-discord-bot sh` (or `bash`)
- Stop & remove: `docker stop amano-discord-bot && docker rm amano-discord-bot`

## Environment variables reference

- **DISCORD_TOKEN** — (required) the bot token from Discord Developer Portal
- **APPLICATION_ID** — (required for registering commands) your application's client id
- **OPENAI_API_KEY** — (optional) OpenAI API key for AI-generated replies; if not provided, the bot will use fallback generic replies
- **MAX_MESSAGE_LIMIT** — (optional; defaults to `20`) maximum number of messages to track per guild for AI context before generating a summary
- **DB_DIALECT** — (optional; defaults to `sqlite`) database dialect/engine to use
- **DB_HOST** — (optional; defaults to `localhost`) database host
- **DB_PORT** — (optional) database port (e.g., `5432` for Postgres)
- **DB_NAME** — (optional; defaults to `amano`) database name used by SQL dialects like MySQL/Postgres
- **DB_USER** — (optional; defaults to `root`) database user
- **DB_PASSWORD** — (optional; defaults to empty password) database password
- **DB_STORAGE** — (optional; only used if `DB_DIALECT=sqlite`; defaults to `:memory:`) storage path for SQLite. which creates an in-memory database. To persist locally set a file path like `./data/dev.db`.
- **DB_FORCE_SYNC** - (optional; disabled by default) if `true`, force syncs the database (not recommended for production)

## Registering commands

To push the commands defined in `src/commands` to Discord, run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This uses `src/util/deploy.js` and requires `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `APPLICATION_ID` in your environment.

## Inviting the bot to a Discord server (self hosted)

1. Get your Application (Client) ID:
   - From the Discord Developer Portal (Applications → your app) or from your local `.env` file as `APPLICATION_ID`.

2. Use the OAuth2 URL generator (recommended):
   - In the Developer Portal go to OAuth2 → URL Generator.
   - Select the scopes: `bot` and `applications.commands` (if you want slash commands).
   - Under "Bot Permissions" select the permissions your bot needs and copy the generated URL.
   - Paste the URL in your browser, choose the server, and authorize the bot (you must have Manage Server or Administrator on the target server).

3. Or build the invite URL manually:
   - Replace APPLICATION_ID and PERMISSIONS_INTEGER in the template below and open it in a browser:
     ```
     https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=APPLICATION_ID&permissions=PERMISSIONS_INTEGER&scope=bot%20applications.commands
     ```
   - Example (Administrator permission — not recommended for production unless required):
     ```
     https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=APPLICATION_ID&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands
     ```

Notes:

- Use the URL generator to get the correct permissions integer for specific permissions instead of using broad permissions like Administrator.
- After inviting the bot, register commands with `npm run deploy` (see "Registering commands" above) if needed.
