# Contributing to Amano Discord Bot

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Amano Discord Bot! We welcome contributions of all kinds, including bug fixes, new features, and documentation improvements.

## Code of Conduct

Please read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes.
4. Write clear, concise commit messages.
5. Submit a pull request.

## Commit Message Guidelines

To maintain a consistent commit history, we follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for commit messages. This helps in understanding the history of changes and automating the release process.

### Format

A commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

### Examples
- `feat(auth): add user login functionality`
- `fix(api): resolve 500 error on user retrieval`
- `docs(CONTRIBUTING): update commit message guidelines`
- `style(ui): improve button visibility`
- `refactor(core): simplify user class methods`
- `perf(data): optimize data fetching algorithms`
- `test(login): add tests for login component`
- `chore(deps): update dependency versions`
